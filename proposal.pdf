For my project, I plan on making a small game in github using the the GML that is used as a native language of gamemaker. 
I plan on discussing different aspects of the Gamemaker language, such as syntax and methods available. 
I will also discuss the drag and drop interface that is available to gamemaker, and try to compare and contrast the two.
Finally, for the game I plan on making, I plan on making a basic prototype of a game with two sides where each is trying to destroy
the others base.
